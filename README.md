A growing collection of personal projects developed throughout my undergraduate years at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI). Started in my freshman year after losing access to a previous project, this repository serves as a safe, evolving portfolio of coursework and passion projects spanning web development, game design, data visualization, and systems programming.

##  Origin Story

After losing access to one of my early projects during freshman year, I created PCUD as a permanent home for my code. This repository has grown to chronicle my journey through RPI, containing both class assignments and side projects that sparked my curiosity.

##  Technologies Used

**Languages:**
- C++ (85.6%)
- JavaScript (6.1%)
- CSS (3.8%)
- HTML (3.3%)
- Python
- PHP

**Frameworks & Libraries:**
- D3.js for data visualization
- nlohmann/json for C++ JSON parsing
- Canvas API for graphics
- TopoJSON for geographic data

##  Skills Demonstrated

- **Web Development:** Responsive design, interactive UIs, modern CSS
- **Data Visualization:** D3.js mapping, heatmaps, interactive charts
- **Systems Programming:** C++ game logic, file I/O, data structures
- **API Integration:** JSON parsing and data management
- **Version Control:** Git workflow and repository management
- **Problem Solving:** Algorithm implementation, user interaction design

##  Academic Context

These projects were developed during my time at RPI, combining coursework requirements with personal experimentation. They represent hands-on learning in:
- Web Science & System Development
- Data Structures & Algorithms
- Object-Oriented Programming
- User Interface Design
- Software Engineering Practices

##  Getting Started

Each project directory contains its own README with specific setup instructions. Most web projects can be run by opening `index.html` in a browser, while C++ projects require compilation.

### Quick Start Examples:

**Web Projects (Recipes, Wheel, HomeSite):**
```bash
cd Recipes
# Open index.html in your browser
```

**C++ Projects (Jeopardy):**
```bash
cd Jeapordy
g++ -std=c++17 jeapordy.cpp -o jeapordy
./jeapordy
```

**Python Projects (DogChatBot):**
```bash
cd DogChatBot
python3 bot.py
```

##  Lessons Learned

Creating PCUD taught me the importance of:
- **Version Control:** Never lose your work again
- **Documentation:** Future you will thank present you
- **Modularity:** Breaking projects into manageable pieces
- **Iteration:** Projects evolve over time
- **Backup Strategies:** Always have a safe place for your code

##  Future Development

This repository continues to grow with new projects and improvements to existing ones. Planned enhancements include:
- Integration of real-time data sources
- Mobile-responsive versions of web apps
- Expanded game features and AI opponents
- Portfolio website redesign

##  License

These projects are personal and educational works.
